I’m a Ph.D candidate working on full-stack benchmarking of machine learning workloads. Benchmarking is crucial to understand workload characteristics, reveal computational bottlenecks, and provide optimization opportunities. I have been working on deep learning and Bayesian inference workloads, by benchmarking them on real systems including CPU, GPU, TPU, highlighting the system bottlenecks, and providing insights on future machine learning system design. I also research on the performance impact of software stacks including frameworks, compilers, runtime scheduling, and machine learning libraries. I received my B.S in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2013. In my spare time, I’m broadly interested in statistics, cognitive science, psychology, photography, music, and literature.
